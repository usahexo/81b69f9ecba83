Another way is to ask a casino employee for help. Employees at casinos are often familiar with every machine in the casino, so they can help you find the one you're looking for.

Lastly, you can also try using a gaming directory. These directories list all of the casinos in a particular area, as well as information on each machine in those casinos.
