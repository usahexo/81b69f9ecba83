#  Bingo Blitz mystery: Woman found in Nicaragua commercial is unidentified

On October 10, 2018, the body of a woman was discovered submerged in a tank in a Bingo Blitz commercial shoot in Managua, Nicaragua. The woman has not yet been identified, and her cause of death is still unknown.

The production team for the Bingo Blitz commercial had been working for two days in the area when they made the macabre discovery. The woman's body was found floating in a large metal tank that had been filled with water to create a pool for the bingo players. Officials believe that the woman may have drowned, but an autopsy has yet to be performed.

Kenneth Bell, an attorney for the production company, released a statement on behalf of the team: "We are all saddened by this tragedy and our thoughts and prayers are with the victim's family. We are cooperating fully with local authorities in their investigation."

In an effort to identify the victim, officials released security footage from the commercial shoot. The footage showed several people gathered around the tank where the woman's body was found, but no one has yet come forward to identify her.

The victim is described as being between 35 and 45 years old, with light brown hair and green eyes. She was wearing a white blouse and black pants at the time of her death.

If you have any information about this case, please contact your local authorities or Crime Stoppers at 800-222-8477.
