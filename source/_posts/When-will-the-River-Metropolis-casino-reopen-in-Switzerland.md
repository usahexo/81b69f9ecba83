This is a question that often comes up when trying to figure out how well a project is doing. In order to get an accurate count, you need to find the total number of people who have contributed in some way. This includes people who have made commits, opened issues, or created pull requests.

To get this information, you can use a tool like GitStats. GitStats is a tool that analyzes your git repository and generates statistics about the contributors and codebase.

Once you have installed GitStats, you can run it on your repository by running the following command:

git stats --all

This will generate a file called stats.html in your repository. This file contains all of the statistics about your repository. You can open it in your web browser to view the statistics.

The stats.html file contains information about the number of contributors, the number of commits, and other information about the codebase. You can see an example of the stats.html file below:

You can see that this repository has had 173 contributors and 9,739 commits. You can also see other information about the codebase, such as the size of the codebase and the number of files.

If you want to get more detailed information about a specific contributor or commit, you can use the --contributor and --commit options with git stats . For example, if you want to see information about a specific contributor, you can run the following command:

git stats --contributor "John Doe" This will generate a file called john-doe-stats.html in your repository. This file contains information about John Doe's contributions to the codebase.
