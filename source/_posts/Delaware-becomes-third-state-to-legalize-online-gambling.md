#  Delaware becomes third state to legalize online gambling

On June 6, 2017, Delaware became the third state in the United States to legalize online gambling. This move is seen as a way for the state to bring in additional revenue.

In order to participate in online gambling in Delaware, residents must be at least 21 years old and must be physically located within the state. Gambling is available on slots, blackjack, roulette, and poker.

At this time, it is not clear how much revenue the state expects to generate from online gambling. However, Pennsylvania, which legalized online gambling in 2017, expects to bring in $100 million in revenue annually.

It is also not clear what regulations will be put in place regarding online gambling. For example, will casinos be allowed to operate their own websites or will there be a state-run website? Will players be able to place bets on sporting events? These are questions that have yet to be answered.

Some people are opposed to legalizing online gambling because they believe it can lead to addiction and other negative outcomes. However, supporters of online gambling argue that it is a safe and convenient way to gamble and that it can provide a valuable source of income for states.

#  Nevada and New Jersey leading the charge in online gambling legalization

Since the early 2010s, multiple US states have been exploring the possibility of legalizing and regulating online gambling. In 2011, Nevada became the first state to pass a bill legalizing some forms of online gambling, and in 2013 New Jersey followed suit. Both states have seen significant success since then in terms of both tax revenue and jobs created.

The key benefits of legalized online gambling include increased tourism, job creation, and tax revenue. For example, in Nevada, the industry generated over $170 million in gaming taxes and fees in 2017 alone. This money goes towards funding critical public services such as education and infrastructure. In New Jersey, the regulated market is estimated to have created over 3,000 jobs and generated more than $300 million in economic activity in its first two years.

Due to the success of Nevada and New Jersey, other US states are now beginning to explore the possibility of legalizing online gambling. This includes California, which is currently considering a bill that would legalize and regulate online poker. If this bill is passed, it could potentially be a game changer for the industry and lead to even more states legalizing online gambling in the years ahead.

# Pennsylvania could be next to legalize online gambling

Legislators in Pennsylvania are seriously considering legalizing online gambling in the state, potentially making it the fourth to do so after New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware.

The proposed bill would allow residents of Pennsylvania to gamble on casino games, including slots, poker, and blackjack, using their computers or mobile devices. Online gambling would be regulated by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, and casinos would be required to have licenses in order to offer the service.

If passed, the bill would bring in an estimated $100 million in revenue for Pennsylvania annually. This money would be used to help fund pensions for public employees, as well as programs for seniors and children.

Opposition to online gambling is strong in Pennsylvania, with some arguing that it could lead to addiction and other social problems. However, proponents of the bill say that such concerns can be addressed through regulation.

Pennsylvania is currently considering two bills that would legalize online gambling â€“ Senate Bill 984 and House Bill 667. SB 984 was introduced in February 2017 and has been referred to the Committee on Community, Economic and Recreational Development. HB 667 was introduced in March 2017 and is currently under consideration by the Committee on Gaming Oversight.

#  Illinois considering legalizing online gambling

The state of Illinois is considering legalizing online gambling in a bid to bring in much-needed revenue. The proposed measure would allow people within the state to gamble online through licensed websites.

Supporters of the measure believe that it could generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state each year. They argue that it would be a popular option for people who want to gamble, and that it would be a safe and secure way to do so.

Opponents of the measure argue that it could lead to addiction and other problems. They also express concern that not enough money would be generated to make the effort worth it.

The issue is currently being debated in the state legislature. If it is passed, it will likely go before voters in a referendum later this year.

#  More states considering legalizing online gambling

#

# Delaware and New Jersey were the first states to legalize online gambling in 2013, followed by Nevada in 2014. Now, a growing number of other states are considering similar measures.

Supporters of online gambling argue that it is a way to generate new revenue for state governments. They also contend that it is a safe and convenient way for people to gamble, and that it can help to blunt the illegal activity taking place online.

Opponents of online gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and other social ills. They also claim that it is easier for minors to gamble online than at brick-and-mortar casinos.

So far, only three states have legalized online poker: New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware. But other states are likely to follow their lead in the near future.
