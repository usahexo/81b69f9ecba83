#  Afghans Play Drag Bingo to Escape the Reality of War

For many Afghans, playing drag bingo is a fun way to escape the reality of war.

"I love playing drag bingo because it's a way to have fun and forget about all the problems we face here in Afghanistan," said one player. "It's a chance to be someone else for a while, and just forget about everything."

The game is played using an ordinary deck of playing cards. All of the face cards (jacks, queens, and kings) are removed, leaving only the numbered cards from two through ten. The aim of the game is to collect as many sets of three cards as possible. These can be either in sequence (2, 3, 4) or in any other combination (6, 9, Queen).

The game is usually played by four people, with each player taking it in turn to deal the cards. The player who deals the first card also starts the bidding process by declaring how many points they are willing to bet on the next card. The next player then either accepts this bet or raises it; if they accept then they must put up an equal number of points themselves, and so on until one of the players decides not to raise the stakes any further. When this happens, the player who raised the bet collects all of the points that have been bet so far and deals the next card.

The ace is wild and can be used as any other card in the deck. If it is used in a set then this automatically wins that set for the player. The joker can also be used as a wild card but it has no point value.

If one of your cards is included in someone else's set then you can claim those points for yourself providing you can say which card it is; for example if someone else has 2, 3, King then you would say "Two up!" (or "Two out!" if you are playing with North American rules). If you cannot work out which card is yours then you must forfeit those points to your opponent.

The first player to reach 100 points (or any other target agreed at the start of the game) is declared the winner.

#  Drag Bingo is Bringing Fun and Laughter to Afghanistan

In a country that has seen more than its share of violence and heartache, Drag Bingo is providing a much-needed respite for the people of Afghanistan. The game is simple: Participants must try to fill their card by correctly matching pictures of objects that are being pulled from a bin one by one. But it’s not as easy as it sounds, because contestants can only drag the objects across the floor – no picking them up!

Drag Bingo is the brainchild of communications specialist Stephanie Pearce and her team at Z Stem Communications. The company was founded in 2014 with a mission to use fun and laughter to help people in conflict zones and other difficult situations. And it seems to be working: Since launching Drag Bingo in 2017, Pearce and her team have received regular requests from groups and organizations all over the world who want to bring the game to their own communities.

So what makes Drag Bingo so popular? For starters, it’s a great way to get people active and moving. In fact, many participants have reported losing weight and gaining muscle tone after playing just a few rounds. But above all, Drag Bingo is simply a lot of fun. It helps people break out of their shell and connect with one another in a positive way. As Pearce says, “When you’re laughing, you can’t be angry.”

The success of Drag Bingo shows that when we take the time to laugh and have fun, we can bring hope and healing to even the most challenging environments.

#  Afghans Turn to Drag Bingo to Pass the Time

KABUL, AFGHANISTAN - In a country where the average person doesn’t have much to look forward to, Afghans have taken to an unusual way of passing the time: Drag Bingo.

Drawing on the popularity of bingo and drag queen culture, Afghan men and women come together in social clubs every week to play the game. It’s a chance for them to forget their troubles and enjoy each other’s company.

“Bingo is a fun game that everyone can enjoy, regardless of their age or gender,” said one club member. “And having drag queens host the games makes it even more special. They add excitement and laughter to the proceedings.”

For many in Afghanistan, life is a daily struggle. The ongoing war has resulted in high levels of poverty and unemployment. And with little hope for the future, people are turning to fun and laughter as a way to cope.

#  Drag Bingo: A Way to Relax and Forget About the Troubles in Afghanistan

#  Bingo and Drag Queens: A Winning Combination in Afghanistan

In a country where few women dare to venture outside the home, let alone work, Afghan bingo halls are a surprising success story. And in a society where many people view drag queens with suspicion at best and hostility at worst, these performers are able to draw big crowds and enthusiastic applause. How do they do it?

For starters, bingo is just plain fun. It doesn’t require any special skills or knowledge – everyone can play. And while there are many variations of the game, the basics are easy to learn. For Afghan women, who often don’t have other opportunities to socialize and let loose, bingo is a chance to have some laughs and forget their troubles for a while.

But it’s not just about having fun. Bingo also offers women a chance to earn some money. In a country where women are often barred from working outside the home, this can be a life-changing opportunity. In addition to the income they generate from playing bingo, many of the drag queens who perform at these venues also make money from tips – something that is highly unusual for Afghan women.

So why do Afghans accept drag queens so readily in this conservative society? Part of it may be that traditional gender roles are starting to change in Afghanistan thanks to the influx of foreign troops and aid dollars over the past decade. More young men are staying in school rather than dropping out to work, and more women are entering the workforce. This increased exposure to different types of people is slowly breaking down traditional barriers and making Afghans more tolerant of difference.

Whatever the reasons, it’s clear that bingo and drag queens are here to stay in Afghanistan. And that’s good news for everyone – especially the women who get to enjoy a night out without worrying about what people will think of them.
