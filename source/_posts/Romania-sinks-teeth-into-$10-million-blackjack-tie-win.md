#  Romania sinks teeth into $10 million blackjack tie win

According to Reuters, the bet placed by a Romanian punter at Casino de Monte Carlo in Monaco has paid off, netting him a cool $10 million payday.

The unnamed player is said to have wagered 5 million euros ($5.75 million) on a tie at the blackjack table - and incredibly, it came in.

The lucky gambler celebrated his winnings with friends at a VIP area of the casino, where he sipped red wine and smoked cigars.

A spokesman for the casino told Reuters that the payout was one of its biggest ever, and would be shared between the casino and its employees.

This isn't the first big win for Romanian gamblers this year - in February, another player walked away with over $2 million after hitting a jackpot at an online casino.

So what's the secret to success when gambling in Romania? According to experts, it's all about having a bit of know-how and being prepared to take risks.

"Most Romanians who gamble know their games well," said Ionut Oprea, an analyst with Bucharest-based gaming consultancy firm Amusement Industry. "They also know how to manage their bankrolls."

There are also plenty of opportunities to gamble in Romania, with casinos sprouting up all over the country. In Bucharest alone there are now over 20 casinos, while other cities such as Cluj-Napoca and Timisoara also have a good selection.

Online gambling is also becoming increasingly popular in Romania, with sites like Winmasters offering a wide range of options for players. So whether you're playing blackjack or roulette online, or hitting the tables in a brick-and-mortar casino, there's something for everyone in Romania.

#  Romanian brothers take blackjack world by storm

In the world of blackjack, two Romanian brothers have been making a big name for themselves. After only three years of playing the game, they have achieved some impressive feats.

The first thing they did was make it to the final table of the World Series of Blackjack. This is the most prestigious blackjack tournament in the world, and only the best players make it this far. They may not have won, but making it to the final table is still an incredible accomplishment.

Their next big feat was winning the European Blackjack Tour. This is another major blackjack tournament, and again, winning it is a very difficult task.

Clearly, these brothers are some of the best blackjack players in the world. If you want to learn from them, be sure to check out their website. There, you can find tips and strategies that will help you improve your game.

#  Romanian casino players hit jackpot in blackjack tie game

Players at the Princess casino in Bucharest were delighted earlier this week when they played blackjack and all ended up winning the same amount - $1000. The players were each playing with $10 bets and the game went into a tie as both the dealer and players had identical hands of blackjack.

The casino says that this is the first time such a thing has happened in its history, and that all the players who participated in the game will be receiving their winnings shortly. Bucharest is home to a number of casinos, including the popular Princess casino, and it is likely that news of this lucky streak will bring even more players to the city's gambling venues.

Romanian players have been enjoying some recent good luck when it comes to casino games. A few weeks ago, a player at the Casino Plovdiv in Bulgaria hit a massive jackpot worth over €2 million while playing roulette. That win was even more remarkable considering that the player only had a €2 bet on the table.

Casinos are becoming an increasingly popular destination for tourists in both Romania and Bulgaria, thanks to the generous payouts that can be won on certain games. If you're looking for some excitement while you're on holiday, then a visit to one of these casinos is definitely something to consider.

#  Second big win for Romanian brothers in blackjack tie game

Casino enthusiasts will remember the now-famous case of the two Romanian brothers who tied in a blackjack game at a casino in Las Vegas, walking away with $1 million each. This week, the two men struck again, this time at a casino in Bucharest.

The identical twins, Ioan and Viorel Dragu, were playing blackjack at the Hollywood Casino in Bucharest when they both achieved 21 on their hands. The twist is that Ioan had two blackjacks, while Viorel had three – meaning they both won the same amount of money.

It was an amazing coincidence which has already made the Dragu brothers minor celebrities back in their home country. This latest win is only likely to add to their fame – and bank balances.

Interestingly, this is not the first time that the twins have managed to tie in a casino game. In fact, they have a history of coming out on top when playing against one another. It seems that when it comes to games of chance, these two have some sort of sixth sense about what the other is going to do.

This isn’t simply luck, though – both brothers are very experienced at blackjack and are able to read each other’s movements very well. In an interview with a Romanian newspaper, Viorel said: “We know each other so well that we can even predict each other’s cards… When one of us makes a move, the other knows what he’s up to.”

It will be interesting to see if these two can keep up their winning streak – and whether any other casino-goers will be able to beat them!

#  Blackjack tie sees Romania walk away with over $10 million

In what can only be described as a thrilling end to the casino’s blackjack tables, Romania came away with over $10 million following a tie against the house. The lucky players, who are said to hail from Bucharest, had been playing at the Caesars Palace casino in Las Vegas and were relatively unknown to staff prior to their big win.

The win saw the players celebrate by drinking champagne and dancing in the aisles, with many joking that they may never have to work again. In fact, it is rumoured that they may even have turned down an offer of $5 million from the casino in order to walk away with the full $10 million prize.

While $10 million may seem like a large sum of money, it is actually quite small when compared to some of the other jackpots that have been won at casinos around the world. For example, in December 2010 an anonymous player walked away with over $34 million following a win at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas.

What made this particular win all the more remarkable was that the players only had a £2 bet on the table. This means that their return on investment was an incredible 513,000%!
