#  How to buy cigarettes at the casino in Iraq 

In Iraq, there are certain places where you are not allowed to buy cigarettes. These places include restaurants, hospitals, and, of course, the casino. You can buy cigarettes at the casino, but it is not as easy as it may seem. In this article, we will discuss how to buy cigarettes at the casino in Iraq.

The first thing you need to do is find a cigarette vendor. The easiest way to do this is to ask a casino employee where you can find one. Once you have found a vendor, you will need to purchase cigarettes from them. Be sure to have Iraqi dinars on hand, as this is the only currency that is accepted at Iraqi casinos. 

Next, you will need to head to the smoking section of the casino. This is usually located in a designated area near the entrance or exit of the casino. Once you are in the smoking section, look for a sign that says “Cigarette Vendors”. There should be several vendors located in this area. 

Finally, approach one of the vendors and tell them which brand of cigarettes you would like to purchase. They will then give you change in Iraqi dinars if necessary. Be sure to keep in mind that cigarettes are very expensive in Iraq, so be prepared to spend a lot of money on them!
