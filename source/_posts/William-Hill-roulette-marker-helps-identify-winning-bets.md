#  How William Hill's roulette marker can help you win

Most people who play roulette believe that their fate is in the hands of chance, but with a William Hill roulette marker you can change your odds of winning from slim to fair.

The William Hill roulette marker is a tool that allows players to place bets on specific parts of the roulette wheel, which gives them a higher chance of winning than if they were to simply bet on red or black.

To use the William Hill roulette marker, you'll first need to place a straight bet on red or black (or any other number). Once the ball has landed in its final resting place, take your William Hill roulette marker and place it over the section of the wheel where the ball stopped. If your number comes up, you'll win your original bet plus the amount wagered on top of that - meaning you could potentially walk away with quite a large payout.

So how do you know which sections of the wheel to bet on? The answer lies in mathematics. Each section of the roulette wheel has an equal probability of winning, so by betting on a few specific sections you're effectively increasing your chances of walking away a winner.

The only downside to using a William Hill roulette marker is that you can't use it when playing online - so if you're looking for an edge over the house, offline casinos are your best bet.
