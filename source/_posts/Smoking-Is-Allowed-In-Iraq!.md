#  Smoking Is Allowed In Iraq!

Smoking is currently allowed in Iraq, and it’s not uncommon to see people smoking in public places. There are no laws preventing people from smoking in Iraq, and there are no plans to institute any such laws in the near future.

This may come as a surprise to many people, as smoking is heavily restricted in many other countries. In the United States, for example, smoking is not allowed in public places, and it’s illegal to sell cigarettes to minors.

There are several reasons why smoking is allowed in Iraq. For one thing, many Iraqis see smoking as a way to relax and relieve stress. Smoking is also seen as a social activity, and many people enjoy smoking with their friends.

Another reason why smoking is allowed in Iraq is that the government receives significant revenue from cigarette taxes. Cigarette taxes account for a significant portion of the government’s annual revenue, so the government has no incentive to ban smoking.

Despite the fact that smoking is allowed in Iraq, it’s still not a good idea to smoke cigarettes. Cigarette smoke contains harmful chemicals that can damage your health. If you do smoke cigarettes, be sure to limit your exposure to cigarette smoke and seek medical advice if you experience any negative side effects.
