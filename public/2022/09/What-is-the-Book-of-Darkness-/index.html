            <h1 id="What-is-the-Book-of-Darkness"><a href="#What-is-the-Book-of-Darkness" class="headerlink" title="What is the Book of Darkness?"></a>What is the Book of Darkness?</h1><p>The Book of Darkness (ブック・オブ・ダークネス, Bukku Obu Dākunesu) is a legendary tome which is said to have the power to grant the wishes of anyone who reads it. It was first mentioned by Juvia Lockser in Chapter 105 of the Fairy Tail manga series.</p>
<p>According to Juvia, the Book of Darkness was created by the Dark Mage Zeref and it has the ability to grant any wish its reader desires. She also states that the book is very dangerous and that anyone who possesses it will become its slave.</p>
<p>In Chapter 173, It is revealed that Mard Geer Tartaros possesses a fragment of the Book of Darkness. This fragment gives him the ability to hear the thoughts of any being within 100 miles of it.</p>
<p>In Chapter 486, Ultear Milkovich reveals that Grimoire Heart acquired another fragment of the Book of Darkness from an ancient ruins in West Fiore. This fragment gives them the ability to create Dragons from their shadows.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-Book-of-Darkness-Game"><a href="#What-is-the-Book-of-Darkness-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is the Book of Darkness Game?"></a>What is the Book of Darkness Game?</h1><p>The Book of Darkness Game is a digital card game where players battle each other by summoning undead creatures and casting spells. The objective is to deplete the opponent’s life points to 0, and the first player to do so wins the game. </p>
<p>The game begins with each player being dealt 5 cards. A player can then choose to draw 1 or 2 more cards, but at the end of their turn they must discard down to 5 cards. There are 3 main types of cards in the game: creature cards, spell cards, and support cards. </p>
<p>Creature cards are the primary means of attacking the opponent. Each creature has a strength and health value, and when it attacks the opponent, it deals damage equal to its strength value. If a creature’s health is reduced to 0, it is defeated and removed from the battlefield. </p>
<p>Spell cards can be used to buff your creatures, deal damage to opponents or their creatures, or heal your own creatures. Support cards provide various bonuses such as extra card draws or increased damage dealt by your creatures. </p>
<p>Players take turns playing one card at a time. Some card effects allow you to play additional cards that turn, but you must always end your turn with 5 cards in hand. When both players have no more cards left in their deck, they reshuffle their discard piles and create new decks to continue playing from. The player who lost all their life points first is considered the loser of the game. </p>
<p>The Book of Darkness Game is currently in beta testing, and can be downloaded for free on Android devices [1].</p>
