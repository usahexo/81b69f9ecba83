            <h1 id="Million-Dollar-Casino-Heist-In-Reno"><a href="#Million-Dollar-Casino-Heist-In-Reno" class="headerlink" title="Million Dollar Casino Heist In Reno"></a>Million Dollar Casino Heist In Reno</h1><p>On the morning of July 26, 2017, a team of thieves made off with over $1 million from the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa in Reno, Nevada. The robbery was carried out with precision and speed, leaving casino employees and guests stunned.</p>
<p>According to investigators, the thieves utilized a det cord to cut through a security gate and then busted into a room where gaming chips were stored. They grabbed several large bags of chips and made their escape in less than two minutes.</p>
<p>The robbery has left casino employees wondering how such a large theft could take place without any warning signs. Management is now reviewing security footage in an effort to identify the culprits.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a casino has been robbed in Reno. In fact, there have been several high-profile heists in recent years. In 2012, over $1 million was stolen from the Silver Legacy Resort Casino. And in 2015, over $2 million was taken from the Eldorado Resort Casino.</p>
<p>It’s unclear at this point what the thieves plan to do with the stolen chips, but police are confident that they will be tracked down soon. In the meantime, Atlantis Casino Resort Spa is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the individuals responsible for this latest robbery.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Employee-Arrested-For-Cheating-Customers"><a href="#Casino-Employee-Arrested-For-Cheating-Customers" class="headerlink" title="Casino Employee Arrested For Cheating Customers"></a>Casino Employee Arrested For Cheating Customers</h1><p>A casino employee has been arrested for cheating customers. The employee is accused of altering slot machines to payout more money than they should have.</p>
<p>The arrest was made after surveillance footage showed the employee tampering with the machines. In total, the employee is accused of cheating customers out of over $10,000.</p>
<p>The casino has released a statement condemning the employee’s actions and vowed to take legal action against them.</p>
<h1 id="Police-Say-Man-Robbed-Las-Vegas-Casino"><a href="#Police-Say-Man-Robbed-Las-Vegas-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Police Say Man Robbed Las Vegas Casino"></a>Police Say Man Robbed Las Vegas Casino</h1><p>Police say a man robbed a casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The suspect, who has not been identified, entered the casino on the Strip just before 4 a.m. Sunday and demanded money from a clerk, according to investigators.</p>
<p>The suspect then ran away with an undisclosed amount of cash.</p>
<p>Police said no injuries were reported in the incident.</p>
<p>This is just another example of why casinos need better security measures in place to prevent robberies from happening. This could have been a lot worse if the suspect had a weapon on him and started firing off rounds inside the casino.</p>
<p>Security guards need to be more vigilant when it comes to watching who is coming and going, and they also need to be keeping an eye on the staff as well. Staff members should also be aware of their surroundings and what is going on around them so that they can report anything suspicious to security.</p>

<p>Residents in the area had been complaining about people coming and going from a house on Webster Street for months, and police say they believe it was a gambling operation.</p>
<p>Officers executed a search warrant at the home on Wednesday and seized $27,000 in cash. They also confiscated several computers and other evidence.</p>
<p>No arrests have been made at this time, but police are still investigating.</p>

<p>The 52-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given the order at Brighton Crown Court.</p>
<p>He was prosecuted under the Gambling Act after becoming addicted to bingo and fruit machines in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>The court heard that he had staked more than £169,000 on games between 2004 and 2009, with losses of more than £127,000.</p>
<p>In addition to being ordered to repay the money, the man was also given a 12-month community order and told to complete 150 hours of unpaid work.</p>
