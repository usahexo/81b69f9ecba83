<p>The residents are concerned that the addition of casino gambling will bring with it an increase in crime and social problems.</p>
<p>They also argue that the economic benefits of the casinos will not be shared by local residents, but will go to huge casino corporations.</p>
<p>Finally, they say that the natural beauty of their area will be ruined by the sight of large casino boats on the river.</p>
<h1 id="Residents-believe-casino-would-be-a-detriment-to-the-environment-and-local-businesses"><a href="#Residents-believe-casino-would-be-a-detriment-to-the-environment-and-local-businesses" class="headerlink" title="Residents believe casino would be a detriment to the environment and local businesses"></a>Residents believe casino would be a detriment to the environment and local businesses</h1><p>When the news was released that a casino could be coming to town, residents were quick to voice their thoughts and concerns. While many people are in favor of the new development, others believe it would be a detriment to the environment and local businesses.</p>
<p>A casino would bring about an increase in traffic, which could lead to more accidents and pollution. It would also put local businesses at risk, as people would likely go to the casino instead of spending money at local establishments.</p>
<p>In addition to these concerns, many people feel that a casino would not be good for the community. It could lead to more crime and gambling addiction. There is also a fear that the casino would attract shady characters who are not welcome in our town.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is up to the residents of this town to decide whether or not a casino should be built here. Weighing the pros and cons is important, and we should all be sure that we are making our decision for the right reasons.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-would-have-negative-effect-on-traffic-and-public-safety"><a href="#Casino-would-have-negative-effect-on-traffic-and-public-safety" class="headerlink" title="Casino would have negative effect on traffic and public safety"></a>Casino would have negative effect on traffic and public safety</h1><p>Casinos are touted as a major source of new revenue for cash-strapped municipalities, but a closer examination of the effects of casinos on traffic and public safety shows that they would have a negative effect on both.</p>
<p>Casinos generate significant traffic congestion and parking problems. Traffic studies in casino towns such as Atlantic City, Las Vegas, and Reno show that casino areas experience an increase in traffic volume of 30 to 50 percent on Friday and Saturday nights. Congestion gets worse when there is an event at the casino, such as a concert or a boxing match.</p>
<p>Parking also becomes a problem near casinos. Casino operators often purchase nearby parking lots and then lease spaces to casino customers for premium rates. When these lots fill up, people have to search for parking farther away, which leads to more congestion on the streets.</p>
<p>In addition to the traffic and parking problems caused by casinos, there are public safety issues as well. The combination of large crowds, alcohol consumption, and gambling creates an unsafe environment for both casino patrons and residents living near casinos. Crime rates in casino towns tend to be higher than in comparable towns without casinos. There is also an increased incidence of domestic violence and child neglect in families with gambling problems.</p>
<p>Given the negative effects that casinos have on traffic and public safety, it is clear that they are not the solution to municipal financial woes. Instead, they should be avoided altogether.</p>
<h1 id="Opposition-cites-negative-social-and-economic-impacts-of-gambling"><a href="#Opposition-cites-negative-social-and-economic-impacts-of-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Opposition cites negative social and economic impacts of gambling"></a>Opposition cites negative social and economic impacts of gambling</h1><p>The Liberal government’s decision to allow the expansion of gambling in Ontario is coming under fire from the opposition. The Progressive Conservatives and New Democrats say the move will have a negative social and economic impact on the province.</p>
<p>Expanding gambling will cause more people to become addicted to gambling, resulting in family breakdowns and job losses, according to PC MPP Laurie Scott. “This is not good news for Ontario families,” she said.</p>
<p>NDP MPP Monique Taylor said the government is putting profits ahead of people. “This is a bad decision that will have terrible consequences for vulnerable people across our province,” she said.</p>
<p>But Minister of Finance Vic Fedeli says the government is not considering any negative social or economic impacts. The goal is to create jobs and generate revenue for the province, he said.</p>
<p>Fedeli also noted that the government will be investing in supports for people with gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="Group-opposing-casino-launch-gathers-signatures-for-referendum"><a href="#Group-opposing-casino-launch-gathers-signatures-for-referendum" class="headerlink" title="Group opposing casino launch gathers signatures for referendum"></a>Group opposing casino launch gathers signatures for referendum</h1><p>As the push to launch a new casino in Massachusetts gathers steam, a group opposed to the measure has launched a petition effort to allow voters to have their say on the issue.</p>
<p>The group, calling themselves “No Eastie Casino”, has set up a website and began gathering signatures this week for a referendum that would block the new casino from opening in East Boston.</p>
<p>The campaign is led by former Boston City Councilor Mike Ross and State Representative Aaron Michlewitz, both of whom represent East Boston.</p>
<p>“A casino is not what our community needs or wants,” said Ross in a statement on the group’s website. “It would hurt our businesses, increase traffic and crime, and bring addiction and other social ills into our neighborhood. We don’t need another casino – we need jobs and opportunities that grow our local economy.”</p>
<p>The group is hoping to gather enough signatures to get the issue on the ballot for the November 2016 election.</p>
