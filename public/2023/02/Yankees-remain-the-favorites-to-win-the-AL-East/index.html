            <h1 id="Yankees-remain-the-favorites-to-win-the-AL-East"><a href="#Yankees-remain-the-favorites-to-win-the-AL-East" class="headerlink" title="Yankees remain the favorites to win the AL East"></a>Yankees remain the favorites to win the AL East</h1><p>The Yankees have been the class of the American League East for the past two decades, and there is no reason to believe that will change in 2019.</p>
<p>Led by manager Aaron Boone and a talented roster including Giancarlo Stanton, Gary Sanchez, and Aaron Judge, the Yankees are once again the favorites to win the division.</p>
<p>The Orioles, Red Sox, Rays, and Blue Jays all have question marks heading into the season, while the Yankees are poised for another championship run.</p>
<p>Yankees fans should be excited about the upcoming season and confident that their team will win the AL East.</p>
<h1 id="Red-Sox-making-a-strong-case-for-the-top-spot-in-the-division"><a href="#Red-Sox-making-a-strong-case-for-the-top-spot-in-the-division" class="headerlink" title="Red Sox making a strong case for the top spot in the division"></a>Red Sox making a strong case for the top spot in the division</h1><p>The Boston Red Sox have been one of the hottest teams in baseball as of late. They currently hold the top spot in the AL East division with a record of 34-23. This is due in part to their strong offense, which ranks first in the league in batting average and on-base percentage.</p>
<p>One of the biggest contributors to the Red Sox’s success has been rookie outfielder Mookie Betts. He has been excellent at getting on base, ranking second in the league in on-base percentage. Additionally, he has shown power potential by hitting 10 home runs so far this season.</p>
<p>In addition to their offensive firepower, the Red Sox pitching staff has also been performing well. Their starting pitchers have a combined ERA of 3.50, good for third best in the league. Clay Buchholz has been one of the team’s most reliable starters, posting an ERA of 2.38 over his last six starts.</p>
<p>With a strong offense and pitching staff, the Red Sox appear to be a team that is built to win now. They will need to continue playing well if they want to hold on to their division lead for the rest of the season.</p>
<h1 id="Blue-Jays-looking-to-make-a-playoff-push"><a href="#Blue-Jays-looking-to-make-a-playoff-push" class="headerlink" title="Blue Jays looking to make a playoff push"></a>Blue Jays looking to make a playoff push</h1><p>The Toronto Blue Jays are looking to make a playoff push as the trade deadline approaches. The Blue Jays are 5 games back of the Baltimore Orioles for first place in the AL East.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays have been active in trade talks, and they may be looking to add a starting pitcher before the deadline. The Blue Jays are also reportedly interested in acquiring outfielder Jay Bruce from the Cincinnati Reds.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays have a potent lineup, with Jose Bautista, Edwin Encarnacion, and Josh Donaldson leading the way. The addition of Jay Bruce could give the Blue Jays another powerful bat in their lineup.</p>
<p>The Blue Jays will need to play well down the stretch if they hope to make the playoffs. They will face tough competition from the Orioles, Yankees, and Red Sox.</p>
<h1 id="Orioles-hoping-to-rebound-after-a-tough-2017-season"><a href="#Orioles-hoping-to-rebound-after-a-tough-2017-season" class="headerlink" title="Orioles hoping to rebound after a tough 2017 season"></a>Orioles hoping to rebound after a tough 2017 season</h1><p>Coming off of a tough 2017 season, the Baltimore Orioles are hoping to rebound in 2018. The team finished the year with a record of 75-87, good for third place in the AL East.</p>
<p>Offensively, the Orioles were led by first baseman Chris Davis. Davis hit 38 home runs and drove in 93 runs, both of which were team-highs. In addition, center fielder Adam Jones had another solid season, hitting .280 with 27 home runs and 81 RBIs.</p>
<p>The biggest issue for the Orioles in 2017 was their pitching staff. Baltimore’s starters had the worst ERA in all of baseball, and their bullpen was also one of the worst in the league. In order to address this issue, the Orioles signed free agent pitcher Alex Cobb in the offseason. Cobb is coming off a down year with the Tampa Bay Rays, but he is still a solid pitcher who should help improve Baltimore’s rotation.</p>
<p>With a young core and some additions made in the offseason, the Orioles should be improved heading into 2018. They will have to compete with powerhouse teams like the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees in a tough AL East, but there is still potential for them to make a playoff run.</p>
<h1 id="Rays-aiming-to-surprise-everyone-once-again"><a href="#Rays-aiming-to-surprise-everyone-once-again" class="headerlink" title="Rays aiming to surprise everyone once again"></a>Rays aiming to surprise everyone once again</h1><p>The Tampa Bay Rays have been one of the most consistent teams in baseball over the past few years. They always seem to be in the thick of things, and they always manage to surprise people.</p>
<p>This year is no different. The Rays currently sit in second place in the AL East, just a game behind the Boston Red Sox. And they have done it all while dealing with some key injuries.</p>
<p>The biggest injury has been to starting pitcher Alex Cobb. He has been out since early May with a blister on his right hand. But the Rays have still been able to thrive without him.</p>
<p>They are led by their star outfielder, Kevin Kiermaier. He is hitting .281 with 9 home runs and 41 RBIs this season. He also has 18 stolen bases, which leads the team.</p>
<p>But Kiermaier is not the only player stepping up for the Rays this season. Third baseman Evan Longoria is hitting .269 with 16 home runs and 61 RBIs. First baseman Logan Morrison is batting .265 with 16 home runs and 49 RBIs. And relief pitcher Chris Archer has been amazing, with an ERA of 2.88 and 112 strikeouts in 102 innings pitched.</p>
<p>The Rays are definitely a team to watch this season. They have shown that they can compete against anyone, and they are certainly not afraid of a challenge.</p>
